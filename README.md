Here we are introducing our snake game. 
Running "make program" on the terminal in this directory will start 
the game. Welcome message will appear on the matrix LED and to start 
the game, the player need to press the navswitch.

After pressing the navswitch, snake with length 1 and an apple will appear
on the matrix LED. The snake will keep moving based on it's current direction.
To move the snake to other direction, the user can push the navswitch either 
to north, south, west or east to change the current direction. 

Once the snake eat an apple, the body of the snake will grow and the apple
will appear on other random place. The challenge for the player is to make
the body of the snake to be as longer as possible by eating more apples 
without hit it's body, otherwise the the game will be over and "Game Over" 
message will be displayed.
